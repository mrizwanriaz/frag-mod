README
This repository contains code snippets from a # MS thesis project titled "Developing New Strategies for Protein Structure Prediction" submitted in 2014. The main objective of this project was to build protein structures using fragment/domain-based templates. The code snippets in this repo are a part of the project and can be used to build protein structures using the aforementioned approach.

To use these code snippets, you will need to have basic knowledge of programming concepts and the ability to use a programming language such as Python. The code is written in Python and requires certain libraries to be installed on your system. These libraries include but are not limited to NumPy, Pandas, and Biopython.

To get started, you can open the code snippets in any Python IDE of your choice. Once you have the code open, you can modify it as per your requirements and then run it to build protein structures using the fragment/domain-based templates.

We hope that these code snippets will be useful to you in your protein structure prediction work. Good luck!
